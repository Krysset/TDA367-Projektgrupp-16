\section{System architecture}

The most overall, top level description of your application. If your application
uses multiple components (such as servers, databases, etc.), describe their
responsibilities here and show how they are dependent on each other and how they
communicate (which protocols etc.)

You will to describe the `flow' of the application at a high level. What happens
if the application is started (and later stopped) and what the normal flow of
operation is. Relate this to the different components (if any) in your
application.
