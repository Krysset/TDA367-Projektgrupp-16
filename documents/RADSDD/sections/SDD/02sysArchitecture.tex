	The most overall, top level description of your application. If your application
	uses multiple components (such as servers, databases, etc.), describe their
	responsibilities here and show how they are dependent on each other and how they
	communicate (which protocols etc.)

	You will to describe the `flow' of the application at a high level. What happens
	if the application is started (and later stopped) and what the normal flow of
	operation is. Relate this to the different components (if any) in your
	application.

Feyrune was mainly created using libgdx , a java game engine, to render and run the game \cite{libgdx}, and Tiled to create and design the maps \cite{tiled}. \\\\
When the application is started you as a player is thrown into a world that can be explored. When the application is closed nothing is saved and if you start the application you will be at the same staring point as the first time you started the application.\\
The application flow can be described by the following game loop:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The player explores the map.
	\item The player encounters an enemy.
	\item The player defeats said enemy and gets stronger or is defeated and have to get stronger to defeat said enemy and have to fight easier monsters to get stronger before tackling the stronger monster again.
	\item The player continues exploring.
\end{enumerate}
