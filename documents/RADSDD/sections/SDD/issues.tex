Following is a list of all known issues:
\begin{itemize}[$\circ$]
	\item The different creatures aren't shown during combat.
	\item What ability to use in combat is chosen for you.
	\item Creatures regain full health after every encounter.
	\item All UI elements are the same sprite called choiceDialog.png, this might get confusing while reading the code and is also pretty ugly.
	\item There is an issue with the function resizeImage in class Image. The issue is that it scrambles the image path so you cant use risizeImage on the same image more then once. This could possibly be sovled by applying the path onto the new image.
\end{itemize}
