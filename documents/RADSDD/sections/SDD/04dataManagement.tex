If your application makes use of persistent data (for example stores user
profiles etc.), then explain how you store data (and other resources such as
icons, images, audio, etc.).

No data is stored and all images are stored using tileset .png files in the assets folder. The maps are stored in a similar vein by using .tmx files that are also stored in the assets folder. The .tmx files contain \emph{all} relevant data for the given map.
