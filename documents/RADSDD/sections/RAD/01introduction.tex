\subsection{The Background}
Feyrune, as is the name of the application, was first conceptualized in the beginning as a Pok√©mon-style RPG, but with the ability to be easily extended with new functionality to differentiate itself.

\subsection{Functionality}
Functionality wise the game has two main areas, the overworld and combat. The overworld pertains to functionality such as moving around the map, and travelling to new areas. Combat is the other main area of functionality, and is where the player will be able to fight against enemies. The combat system is turn-based, and will be able to be extended with new functionality to make it more interesting. These two different areas of functionality is glued together by an encounter system, which determines when the player encounters an enemy and initiates combat with them.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
The stakeholders for the project is the general populace, but mostly the people who are interested in RPGs and games with tactical turn-based combat. The game will be free to play and will be available on PC.
