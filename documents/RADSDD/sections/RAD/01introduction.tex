\subsection{The Background}
\href{https://www.amazon.com/Restaurant-at-End-Universe/dp/0345391810}{
	In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.}\\
To solve this problem we have decided to create a game, but not just any game, the GREATEST GAME TO EVER EXIST!\\
This super awesome game, the one we call Feyrune (*Loud gasping!*) is best described as a medieval, fantasy themed, Pok√©mon(tm) ripoff.\\

\subsection{Functionality}
The application is a game with limited functionality. While it can't help you with the meaning of life, or even file your taxes, it can bring a smile to your face.=)

\subsection{Stakeholders}


The purpose of this application is to help the user to have fun on their free time,as it is a game. In the game, you take control of a character that has tamed a creature that can be used for battle.
