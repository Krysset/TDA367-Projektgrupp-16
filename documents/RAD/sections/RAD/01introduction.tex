\subsection{The Bakground}
\href{https://www.amazon.com/Restaurant-at-End-Universe/dp/0345391810}{
	In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.}\\
To solve this problem we have decided to create a game, but not just any game, the GREATEST GAME TO EVER EXIST!\\
This super awesome game, the one we call Feyrune (*Loud gasping!*) is best described as a medieval, fantasy themed, pok√©mon(tm) ripoff.\\
The purpose of this application is to help the user to have fun on their free time,as it is a game. In the game, you take control of a character that has tamed a creature that can be used for battle.
